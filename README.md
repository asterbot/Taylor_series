# Taylor_series
This is a way to experiment and understand how mathematical functions can be expressed as polynomials!

The program uses the following python libraries:
<ul>
  <li>matplotlib
  <li>numpy
  <li>tkinter
</ul>

When the program starts, you will see the taylor expansions of a few functions and radio buttons corresponding to them.
<br>Choose any function you wish and click "Plot graph"
<br>Then once the graph is plotted on matplotlib, you may keep clicking "next term" and seeing the polynomial expansion keep getting closer to the function
<br>The program can only plot till 6 terms, since the cartesian plane is self designed
<br><br>Make sure to download the image file(yes.ppm) too to see the expansions image
